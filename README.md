# Ship_Crew_Prediction_PySpark
This project leverages PySpark and machine learning to predict the number of crew members required on a cruise ship using key ship attributes like tonnage, passenger capacity, length, and more. The solution applies a regression model using Spark MLlib library and provides actionable insights into how ship specifications impact crew requirements.
